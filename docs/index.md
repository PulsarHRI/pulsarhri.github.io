### ⚡ First Time Here?

Start with the [**Quickstart No-Code Guide**](quickstart.md) to power on your actuator and get moving in minutes!


### 🧰 What Else Can I Find?

- 🐍 [Scripting with the Python API](python_api/install_python_api.md)  
- 🧠 [Simulation with the AUGUR Digital Twin](digital_twin/digital_twin.md)  
- 🎛️ [Overview of supported actuator control modes](control/00-control-modes-overview.md)  

!!! note
    A quick alignment on naming we use:
    
    - **Motors** = Direct-drive units without transmission  
    - **Actuators** = Motors with integrated transmission
