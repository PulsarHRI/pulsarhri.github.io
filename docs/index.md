Welcome to the PULSAR HRI documentation! This documentation contains everything you need to begin working with the PULSAR HRI Actuators or PULSAR HRI Motors. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or engineer, this guide will walk you through setting up your environment, installing the packages, and accessing the documentation and examples.

The PULSAR HRI packages is designed to provide a robust and flexible interface for controlling and monitoring PULSAR HRI hardware. It includes:

* A Python package for controlling the real hardware
* A Python package for controlling the digital twin (AUGUR)
* Example scripts for common use cases
* Detailed descriptions of available classes, methods, and parameters
* Best practices for integration and deployment

## Overview of the PULSAR HRI ecosystem

!!! note
    * When we refer to motors we refer to direct drive motors without transmission
    * When we refer to actuators we refer to motors with a transmission

PULSAR HRI develops best-in-class actuation systems to enable the next generation of robotic capabilities. Our aim is to provide the highest possible performance in motors and actuators, defining excellence through novel metrics involving agility, torque-density, and efficiency. Our model-based design approach enables us to deliver high-performance actuators alongside high-fidelity digital twins (AUGUR). This documentation contains all the necessary resources to set up either a simulation or a physical configuration using our products.
