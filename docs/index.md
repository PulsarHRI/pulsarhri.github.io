## 🗺️ Ecosystem Overview

!!! note on naming
    - **Motors** = Direct-drive units without transmission  
    - **Actuators** = Motors with integrated transmission

PULSAR HRI develops best-in-class actuation systems to enable next-generation robotics. Our mission is to push the frontier of performance with:

- ⚡ High **agility**, **torque-density**, and **efficiency**  
- 🧩 Seamless **simulation-to-real** correspondence  
- 🛠️ Full-stack in-house development: motors, transmissions, electronics, and models

To explore our simulation tools, visit the [AUGUR Digital Twin section](digital_twin/digital_twin.md).
