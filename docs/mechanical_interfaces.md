## 3D Models

Before running a Pulsar Actuator, we recommend attaching it to a generic bracket.

In this way you can get some hands-on understanding on how to best integrate them mechanically and [electrically](electrical_interfaces.md) in your robotics system, and perform some tests safely starting with following the steps in the [Quickstart page](quickstart.md). 

Below we provide some 3D printable files.
