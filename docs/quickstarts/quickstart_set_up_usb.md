# Quickstart Tutorial: Set up Real Actuator and connect via USB
Follow this tutorial for the fastest way to set up a PULSAR actuator out of the box connected via USB, you will then be able to get it running in no time with the [PULSAR HRI Desktop App](../control/desktop_app/desktop_app.md) next.

## ðŸ§° What Youâ€™ll Need

Usually provided by PULSAR HRI:

  - 1x PULSAR HRI **actuator** 
  - 1x **Power Bus Cable** ([more details here](../set_up/hardware_interfaces/electrical_interfaces.md#power-bus-cable))
  - 1x standard USB-A to **USB-C cable**

Usually NOT provided by PULSAR HRI:

  - A **mechanical support** and **screws** to secure the actuator ([more details and some designs you can 3D-print here](../set_up/hardware_interfaces/mechanical_interfaces.md))
  - A 48V **Power Supply Unit** ([more details here](../set_up/hardware_interfaces/electrical_interfaces.md#power-bus))
  - A **Computer**  
  
!!! Operating-System-Compatibility
    Currently the ecosystem is mainly compatible with, and tested on Windows and Linux Ubuntu operaing systems

## ðŸ‘£ Step-By-Step Guide

1. Connect the the Power Bus Cable to the Power Supply Unit, plug it into the actuator.
