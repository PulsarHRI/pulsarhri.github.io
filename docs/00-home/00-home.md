Welcome to the Pulsar documentation wiki! This wiki contains everything you need to begin working with the Pulsar Actuators or Pulsar Motors. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or engineer, this guide will walk you through setting up your environment, installing the API, and accessing the documentation and examples.

The Pulsar API is designed to provide a robust and flexible interface for controlling and monitoring Pulsar hardware. It includes:

* A Python package for controlling the real hardware
* A Python package for controlling the digital twin (AUGUR)
* Example scripts for common use cases
* Detailed descriptions of available classes, methods, and parameters
* Best practices for integration and deployment
