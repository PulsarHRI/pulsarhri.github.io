# Pulsar Desktop App

The **Pulsar Desktop App** provides the simplest way to get started with a Pulsar Actuator. It offers a graphical interface (GUI) to configure, control, and monitor the actuator without writing any code.

This tool is ideal for:
- **Quick testing** and tuning actuator parameters
- **Visualizing data** such as position, speed, and torque
- **Running diagnostics** without using scripts

### ⚙️ System Requirements

- **Connection**: The actuator must be **powered** and connected **directly via USB**
- **Compatibility**: Tested on **Windows**  
  > _Linux and macOS support is experimental and currently under review_

At this stage, the app supports controlling **one actuator at a time**.

### 📦 How to Get the App
